I am a freelance software engineer with interests in web development, music, and web3.

As a full-time freelancer, I work on various projects. I prefer not to disclose the names of the companies I work with, but you can get hints if you follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. This approach helps ensure that I do not inadvertently violate any non-disclosure agreements when discussing work-related topics.
